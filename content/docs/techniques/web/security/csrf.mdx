## What is Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) ?

<b>CSRF</b> is a type of web vulnerability that allows the attackers to trick user into performing
unwanted actions on a web application where they are authenticated.

The attackers can create links that resemble familiar applications, such as "faceebook.com" instead of "facebook.com".
Clicking on these links can unknowingly send requests to the Facebook server, potentially leading to unwanted consequences for your account.

## How dangerous are CSRF attacks ?

<b>Transferring funds or Making purchases:</b>
Attackers could initiate unauthorized money transfers from your bank account or make purchases on.
your behalf from online stores.

<b>Posting unwanted content:</b>
Attackers could post messages or content on your social media accounts or other online platforms.

<b>Modifying sensitive data:</b>
Attackers could change your account settings, passwords or other personal information.

The cost can be significant depends on the attackers skills.

## How to property prevent CSRF attacks ?

There are severals methods to prevent <b>CSRF</b> attacks:

<b>Use Anti-CSRF Tokens:</b>
This is the most common and effective method to prevent a <b>CSRF</b> attack. Each form submission
includes a unique, unpredictable token that the server verifies. When a CSRF token is generated it
should be stored server-side within the user's session data. When a subsequent request is received
that requires validation, the server-side application should verify that the request includes a
token which matches the value that was stored in the user's session.

In the form on client-side should have a hidden field that holds the value of the token that generated on server-side:
`<input type="hidden" name="csrf-token" value="aTokenThatGeneratedOnServer" />`.

<b>SameSite Cookie Attribute:</b>
This attribute helps the browser decide whether to send cookies along with cross-site requests. The
values of this attribute are `Lax`, `Strict` or `None`. The `Strict` value will prevent the cookie
from being sent by the browser to the target site in all cross-site browsing context, even when
following a regular link. This attribute should not replace a CSRF Token. It should co-exist with
the token to protect the user like a second layer of defense.

<b>Check the Origin and Referrer Headers:</b>
