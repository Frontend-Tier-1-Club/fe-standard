# JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Security

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a widely used standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
This document outlines JWT's security features, potential vulnerabilities, and best practices for secure implementation.

## Why is JWT Token ?

In the early days of web development, developer want to find a way to manage user authentication and sessions in a more efficient and secure manner. Before the widespread use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens), they relied on several older methods to manage authentication and user sessions like cookies and server-side sessions.
But it had their limitations:

### 1. Server-Side Sessions Problems ?

The server stored all session data (e.g., user ID, permissions) and associated it with the session
ID.

<b>Drawbacks:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Scalability:</b> Storing sessions on the server meant more resource consumption as the user
    base grew.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Distributed Systems:</b> Sessions needed synchronization between servers in load-balanced
    environments, requiring complex setups (e.g., sticky sessions or centralized session stores like
    Redis).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Revocation Complexity:</b> Managing session invalidation for logout or security purposes was
    challenging.
  </li>
</ul>

### 2. Cookies Problems ?

Cookies stored session data on the client side, with the server validating the session ID.

<b>Drawbacks:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Vulnerable to XSS/CSRF:</b> Cookies could be intercepted or forged if not properly secured.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Limited Storage:</b> Cookies had a 4KB size limit, restricting what could be stored.
  </li>
</ul>

### 3. HTTP Basic Authentication Problems ?

User credentials (username and password) were sent with every request in the Authorization header.

<b>Drawbacks:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Insecure:</b> Repeatedly transmitting credentials increased the risk of interception, even
    with HTTPS.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>User Experience:</b> Required constant re-authentication or browser pop-ups for credential
    input.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Sessionless:</b> No support for "remember me" or session persistence.
  </li>
</ul>

### 4. JWT Is Preferred Over Older Methods

JWTs addressed many of the issues with previous approaches:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Statelessness:</b> Tokens are self-contained; no server-side storage is required.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Scalability:</b> Simplifies distributed systems since the token itself carries all necessary
    data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Interoperability:</b> Standardized format (JSON) makes it easy to integrate across systems
    and platforms.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Security:</b> When used with best practices (e.g., signing, encryption), JWTs provide robust
    authentication and authorization.
  </li>
</ul>

## What is a JWT Token ?

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact and self-contained method for transmitting information between parties. A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header and payload are Base64Url encoded JSON strings, and the signature is a cryptographic hash of the header, payload, and a secret key.

The header contains metadata about the JWT, such as the algorithm used to sign the token. The
payload contains claims, which are statements about an entity and additional data. Claims can be
used to represent user information, permissions, or other metadata. The signature is used to verify
that the JWT is valid and has not been tampered with.

### Structure of a JWT

A JWT is divided into three parts, separated by dots (`.`):

1. **Header**: Contains metadata, such as the type of token and the signing algorithm (e.g., `HS256` or `RS256`).
2. **Payload**: Contains claims, which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data.
3. **Signature**: Ensures the integrity of the token by allowing verification of its authenticity.

Example:

```text
<base64UrlEncode(header)>.<base64UrlEncode(payload)>.<signature>
```

---

#### 1. Header

The header contains metadata about the token, including the type of token and the signing algorithm used. It is a JSON object encoded in Base64Url format. This metadata is crucial for both the sender and the recipient to understand how to process the token. For example:

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

- **`alg`**: Specifies the algorithm used to sign the token. Common algorithms include:

  - `HS256` (HMAC using SHA-256): Symmetric key algorithm. Both parties share a secret key for signing and verification. Easy to implement but requires secure key management.
  - `RS256` (RSA signature with SHA-256): Asymmetric key algorithm using a private key for signing and a public key for verification. Ideal for distributed systems as only the private key must remain secure.
  - `ES256` (ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256): Asymmetric key algorithm based on elliptic curves. Offers similar security to RSA but with smaller key sizes and faster performance.
  - `PS256` (RSA-PSS using SHA-256): An advanced variant of RSA with a probabilistic signature scheme, providing stronger cryptographic assurances against certain types of attacks.
  - `EdDSA` (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm): A highly secure and performant algorithm, often used with Ed25519.

- **`typ`**: Indicates the type of token. Usually set to `JWT` to denote a JSON Web Token.

The `alg` and `typ` fields in the header provide critical information for validating the token’s signature and ensuring proper cryptographic handling. Misconfiguration or unsupported algorithms can introduce vulnerabilities, so these fields must be validated rigorously.

#### 2. Payload

The payload contains the claims, which are statements about the entity (user) and additional data. Example:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "email": "kevin.tran@techvify.com.vn",
  "name": "Kevin Tran",
  "role": "ADMIN",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "exp": 1516245022
}
```

- **Registered Claims**: Predefined claims that provide useful, standardized metadata:

  <Table headers={["Atribute", "Description"]} data={data} />

- **Custom Claims**: Application-specific data. For example, `role` or `permissions`. Avoid including sensitive information here as the payload is not encrypted.

#### 3. Signature

The signature is created by encoding the header and payload, then signing it using a secret key or a private key, depending on the algorithm. The signature ensures the token's integrity and authenticity. For example:

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
```

- **Symmetric Algorithms (e.g., HS256)**: Use the same key for signing and verification. Both the sender and receiver must securely share the key.
- **Asymmetric Algorithms (e.g., RS256, ES256)**: Use a private key for signing and a public key for verification. Only the issuer needs to keep the private key secure.

The output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments, while being more compact when compared to XML-based standards such as SAML.

## How to Work With JWT ?

How are signed tokens used in authentication? Here’s a simplified outline of the process:

1. A user signs into their account on an authentication server
2. The authentication server returns a signed token with their account information or an ID (or both)
3. The signed token is stored in the browser’s localStorage or sessionStorage or anywhere the website prefers to store it
4. The signed token is retrieved and used anytime a part of the website needs authenticated access

Here’s a visual representation of the process:

## The problem JWT aims to solve

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) address several business pain points, particularly in modern application architectures and security models.

### Scalability in Authentication

A growing e-commerce platform hosts millions of users who frequently log in,
browse products, and make purchases. The platform initially implemented session-based
authentication, where user sessions are stored on the server. However, as the platform scaled, this
approach began to show significant limitations, even though it can become a bottleneck as the user
base grows

<b>Solution with JWT:</b> JWTs are stateless and do not require server-side storage. The token
itself carries all the necessary data for authentication, allowing seamless scaling across
distributed systems.

### Cost Management

A growing SaaS company offers a multi-tenant platform used by thousands of
businesses. As their user base expands, they face escalating costs in managing authentication and
session storage due to traditional session-based authentication.

<b>Solution with JWT:</b> By removing the dependency on session storage, JWTs reduce infrastructure
costs and simplify system architecture.

### Security Concerns

Traditional authentication methods often expose sensitive session data to risks
like session hijacking. However, many companies especially the fintech companies manage an online
banking platform where users perform sensitive transactions like fund transfers and account
management. The platform initially uses traditional session-based authentication. However, the
company encounters significant security risks

<b>Solution with JWT:</b> Tokens are signed and optionally encrypted, ensuring integrity and
confidentiality. They can include short expiration times and support mechanisms like refresh tokens
to minimize risks.

### Developer Productivity

A logistics company operates a digital platform where users access services via
web, mobile apps (iOS and Android), and APIs for third-party integrations. They face challenges with
consistent authentication across all platforms due to differing technologies and session management
requirements.

<b>Solution with JWT:</b> JWT solves cross-platform compatibility pain points by offering a
standardized, portable, and secure authentication method that works seamlessly across web, mobile,
and API environments.

### Customer Experience

A subscription-based streaming service offers users access to content across
multiple devices, including web, mobile, smart TVs, and gaming consoles. Customers expect quick and
seamless authentication, but traditional methods create friction, leading to frustration and
drop-offs.

<b>Solution with JWT:</b> JWTs can support single sign-on (SSO) and allow users to remain logged in
across multiple devices and services until the token expires.

## Challenges and Limitations of JWT

While JWTs offer many benefits, they also come with challenges and limitations that developers must consider:

### Limited Token Size

JWTs can become significantly larger than traditional session IDs because they contain headers,
payloads, and cryptographic signatures. If you use the JSON Compact Serialized format (most common format),
you have to keep in mind that it should be as short as possible because it is mainly used in a web context. A <b>4kb</b> JWT is something that you should avoid.

<b>Impact:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Increases bandwidth usage, especially in systems with frequent requests.</li>
  <li>May impact performance over slow networks (e.g., mobile or IoT).</li>
</ul>

### Revocation Complexity

Despite the convenience and efficiency offered by JWT tokens, they have a significant limitation
when it comes to handling revoked tokens. Consider a scenario where a user’s access rights are
revoked before the expiration time of their JWT token. In this case, the resource server has no way
of knowing that the token has been revoked. It will continue to accept the token as valid until it
expires, potentially allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.

<b>Impact:</b>
<ul>
  <li>If a JWT is compromised, it remains valid until it expires.</li>
  <li>May impact performance over slow networks (e.g., mobile or IoT).</li>
</ul>

### Expiration and Rotation

One challenge when using JWTs is handling token rotation and key updates. JWTs have an expiration
time, after which they are considered invalid. When a token needs to be renewed or rotated, it’s
important to ensure a smooth transition without disrupting the user experience. In addition,
periodically updating the signing key helps enhance security and mitigate the impact of a
compromised key.

<b>Impact:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Short-lived tokens enhance security but require refresh tokens, adding complexity to token
    rotation.
  </li>
  <li>Long-lived tokens increase security risks if they are compromised.</li>
</ul>

### Security Risk

In the world of web security, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) play a pivotal in role in managing
authentication and maintaining session information. However, the security of JWTs is only as robust
as the mechanisms and practices employed to handle them.

<b>Impact:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Token Tampering:</b> Without proper signature verification, JWTs can be altered by attackers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Algorithm Confusion:</b> Misconfiguration of signing algorithms (e.g., using "none") can lead
    to vulnerabilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Sensitive Data Exposure:</b> Claims stored in the payload can be decoded easily if not
    encrypted, exposing sensitive information.
  </li>
</ul>

### Compatibility

JWTs follow a widely accepted standard (RFC 7519), which makes them suitable for modern
applications. However, integrating JWTs into existing systems or across diverse environments can
present compatibility challenges. These issues often arise in legacy systems, heterogeneous
ecosystems, and when dealing with varying standards and protocols.

<b>Impact:</b>
<ul>
  <li>May require additional middleware or libraries to handle JWTs in legacy systems.</li>
  <li>
    Compatibility issues can arise when integrating JWTs into systems with different encryption
    standards.
  </li>
</ul>

## Conclusion

JWTs are a powerful tool for authentication and secure data exchange. However, they must be implemented with care to avoid common pitfalls. Following best practices ensures that your application remains secure while leveraging the benefits of JWTs.
