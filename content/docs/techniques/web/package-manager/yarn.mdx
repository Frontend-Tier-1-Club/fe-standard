## Overview

`Yarn` simplifies managing package dependencies by handling installation, updates, configuration, and removal.
This helps you achieve your goals faster and with fewer distractions.

Focusing on speed, accuracy, security, and a seamless developer experience, `Yarn` is a valuable tool in the JavaScript ecosystem.
It enhances efficiency, ensures safety, and delivers a positive development experience for projects of any scale.

## Benefits

- **Stability**: `Yarn Modern` was developed after years of experience with maintaining Yarn Classic.
  Its design addresses the shortcomings identified in the earlier version, resulting in significantly improved stability.

- **New features**: `Yarn Modern` provides many new features that didn't exist in `Yarn 1.x` - or any other package managers for that matter.
  As an example, `Constraints` are exclusive to Yarn Modern.

- **Flexibility**: `Yarn Modern` supports all three installation strategies: `Yarn PnP`, `node_modules`, and via a `pnpm-like` content-addressed cache.
  No matter which one you prefer, you have it at your disposal.

- **Extensibility**: `Yarn Modern`'s flexible architecture empowers you to create custom features whenever you need them. There's no need to wait for us to implement the features you wantâ€”you can develop them yourself, tailor them to your specific requirements, and start using them immediately.
  It supports focused workspaces, custom installations, project validation, and more..

- **Future proof**: `Yarn Modern` was created to address the challenges of adding new features to `Yarn Classic`, where changes often had unpredictable consequences.
  This limitation has been resolved, as demonstrated by the numerous features introduced in recent major releases.
