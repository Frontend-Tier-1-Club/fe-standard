## What is pnpm?

`pnpm` is a drop-in replacement for `npm`. It is built on top of `npm` and is much faster and more efficient than its predecessor.
It is highly disk efficient and solves inherent issues in `npm` like disk space usage, network bandwidth, and installation speed.

## Why did you need to care to pnpm?

`pnpm` provides many advantages over npm and yarn. Some of the core features include:

1. **Disk Space Efficiency**: <br />`pnpm` uses a single storage for all projects on a machine, which means that it doesn't duplicate the same packages across different projects. This results in significant disk space savings.
   \*Example: <br />
   If a package version 1 has 500 files and version 2 has just one more file, then `pnpm` will not write 501 files for version 2;
   instead, it will create a hard link to the original 500 files and write just the new file.
   If you compare it with npm, then version 2 will also be loaded with duplicating the original 500 files. For large monorepo projects, it can make a big difference. Image a scenario where a package is needed by hundreds of other packages that will be killing your disk space unless you use `pnpm`

2. **Improved speed**: <br />
   The speed of package installation with `pnpm` is significantly better than `npm` and `yarn`.
   If you look at the below benchmark tests, you can see that pnpm performs better in most cases thano `npm` and `yarn`

3. **Security**: <br />
   `Pnpm`, like `yarn`, has a special file with the checksum of all the installed packages. This ensures the integrity of all the installed packages before their code is executed.

   In terms of unprivileged access, `pnpm` also outperforms `npm` and `yarn`. In the case of `npm`
   and `yarn`, If package A depends on package B, and B depends on C, then A implicitly gets access
   to C even though A has not declared C as its dependency. This problem is intensified in a large
   monorepo setup. Pnpm, on the other hand, uses a different dependency resolution algorithm and
   different folder structure of node_modules that prevents illegal access to packages. \*Noted: <br />
   `pnpm` has excellent support for monorepo and offline mode.

## pnpm CLI commands

Here are some of the basic commands: <br />

- `pnpm init`: Create a new `package.json` file
- `pnpm install`: Install all dependencies
- `pnpm install <package-name>`: Install a specific package
- `pnpm add <package-name>`: Download a particular version of a package and add to the list of dependencies in package.json
- `pnpm remove <package-name>`: Remove a package from the list of dependencies in `package.json`
- `pnpm update`: Update all packages to the latest version

* `pnpm install` vs `pnpm add`:
  - `pnpm install` is used to install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
  - `pnpm add` is used to install a specific package and add it to the list of dependencies in the `package.json` file.

## Why Choose pnpm for Monorepos?

`pnpm` is a great choice for monorepos because `pnpm` stands out for its unique approach to handling `node_modules`,
creating a single version of each package and hard-linking them across projects.
This results in significant disk space savings and faster installations.

Example: <br />
Using `pnpm` and `vite` to a monorepos source code strucure like below:

<img src="/images/javascript/package-manager/pnpm_monorepos_structure.png" alt="pnpm-monorepos" />

In `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file, you can define the workspace and the packages that are part of the workspace.

```
packages:
  - 'website'
  - 'packages/*'

```

CD to `website folder` to run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies for the website package.
It will detect the workspaces and create a pnpm-lock.yaml in the root directory. In the lock file, dependencies are written under the package name website.

In packages/utils

- Create a `package.json` folder

```
{
  "name": "@mono/utils",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "scripts": {
    ...
  }
}
```

The package has been renamed with @mono/utils and set the main file path.

<br />
In packages/ui folder
- Using `vite` to create the ui app and have the run script in the `package.json` file
```
{
  "name": "@mono/ui",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite"
  }
}
```

_Using packages on the website_

- In the website package, you can import the utils and ui packages like below:
  `/website/package.json`

```
{
  "name": "website",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "@mono/ui": "workspace:*",
    "@mono/utils": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

- Install dependencies with `pnpm install` and you can use the packages in the website package.

## Pnpm `node_modules` structure

`Symlinks` are symbolic links that pnpm uses to create a nested structure of dependencies.
pnpm's `node_modules` layout uses symbolic links to create a nested structure of dependencies.

`a hard link` is a different reference to the same file. In soft link, you create a new file, and the contents of the file point to another path. <br />
A hard link refers directly to physical data on the disk. Multiple hard links to one file refer to the same data; it is the same inode. So, any changes made to the file via any hard link are reflected in all hard links.
Every file of every package inside `node_modules` is a hard link to the content-addressable store.

Example:

<img src="/images/javascript/package-manager/symlinked.png" alt="pnpm-symlinked-node_modules" />

These are the only "real" files in node_modules. Once all the packages are hard linked to node_modules, symbolic links are created to build the nested dependency graph structure.
Both packages are hard linked into a subfolder inside a node_modules folder

```bash
# Traditional approach (npm/yarn)
node_modules/
└── react/                  # 1MB
    └── node_modules/
        └── dependencyA/      # 800KB
            └── node_modules/
                └── dependencyB/ # 400KB
# Total:  2.2MB

# PNPM approach
.pnpm/               # 2.2MB (shared across ALL projects)
projectA/node_modules/     # ~0MB (hard links)
projectB/node_modules/     # ~0MB (hard links)
projectC/node_modules/     # ~0MB (hard links)
```

## PNPM Hoisted Mode

Hoisted mode is an alternative node_modules structure that makes PNPM behave more like npm/yarn,
useful for compatibility with older tools or specific use cases.

Example:
I have 2 imports in express app

```
const express = require('express');
const moment = require('moment');
```

- With default mode, only works if 'moment' is in package.json
- With hoisted mode, it will hoist the moment package to the top level of node_modules. Works even if 'moment' is a dependency of a dependency

```
node_modules/
└── moment/
    └── node_modules/
        └── express/
```

I created a React + Vite with Pnpm and installed `mui/material`

- Create `.npmrc` file and add `node-linker=hoisted`
- You can check the `node-linker` mode by this command `pnpm config get node-linker`

After I installed, the result of node_modules is:

<img src="/images/javascript/package-manager/pnpm-hoisted-mode.png" alt="pnpm-hoisted" />

In this case, I've installed `@mui/material`, in `node_modules` folder. <br />
I have 2 new packages are `@mui` and `@emotion` (the MUI dependency)<br />
So with this setup `Emotion` (styling engine) packages are available and All Material-UI sub-dependencies are accessible

_Noted_: You can run this command to see the full dependency tree with hoisting:<br />
`pnpm list -r --json`

## Pnpm Limitations

1. **Compatibility**: <br />
   `pnpm` is not compatible with all packages. Some packages may not work with `pnpm` due to the way they are written.
   However, this is a rare case and most packages work well with `pnpm`.

2. **Learning Curve**: <br />
   `pnpm` has a different approach to handling dependencies, which may require some time to get used to.

3. **Community Support**: <br />
   `pnpm` has a smaller community compared to `npm` and `yarn`. This may result in slower updates and fewer resources available online.
