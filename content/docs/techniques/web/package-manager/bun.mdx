`Bun` is a newer entry in the package management space, designed from the ground up to be a faster,
more modern alternative to `npm`, `pnpm` and `Yarn`.

<h2>What can Bun do?</h2>

<h4>All-in-one Toolkit </h4>

Bun is more than just a JavaScript runtime. It has become an All-In-One toolkit,
used from the develop, test, run, and bundle stages when developing JavaScript and TypeScript applications:

1. <b>Package manager </b>
   <br />
   Bun is a package manager that can be compared to npm, pnpm, and Yarn. It can be used to install,
   update, and remove packages from the project. Besides, Bun can also be used to manage the
   project's dependencies, which are stored in the `package.json` file, but Bun use `bun.lockb` file
   to store the dependencies' versions.

2. <b>Bundler</b> <br />
   Bun has also just played the role of a bundler, similar to the role of Vite, Webpack. Bun is
   written to be compatible with ESBuild and for better performance. It will be able to replace
   current tools such as: - `esbuid`, `webpack`, `rollup`, `parcel`, `vite`, `snowpack`, etc.
3. <b>Test runner </b> <br />
   Bun has a built-in test runner with a Jest-like expect API. It can be used to run tests and
   generate test reports. Example:

   ```
    import { describe, it, expect } from "bun:test"

    describe("Simple Test Case", () => {
    it("should add two numbers correctly", () => {
        const sum = 1 + 1
        expect(sum).toBe(2)
        })
    })
   ```

   Create file `bun.test.tsx` and run `bun test` to run the test.
   The result will be displayed in the console

4. <b>JavaScript runtime </b> <br /> Bun is a JavaScript runtime that can be used to run JavaScript
   and TypeScript code. It is built on top of JavaScriptCore, which is a high-performance JavaScript
   engine. `Bun` and `NodeJs` are similar in many ways, but there are also some differences.
