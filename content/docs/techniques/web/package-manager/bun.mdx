`Bun` is a newer entry in the package management space, designed from the ground up to be a faster,
more modern alternative to `npm`, `pnpm` and `Yarn`.

<h2>Why did you need to care to bun?</h2>
1. <h4>Speed</h4> 
<b>Super-fast package management</b>: Bun is significantly faster than other package
managers like npm and Yarn, thanks to its native implementation in Zig and a focus on performance. 
`Bun` aims to reduce cold start times for scripts and servers compared to Node.js. 
2. <h4>Modern APIs</h4>
<b>Web standard APIs</b>: Bun implements modern web standards like fetch, WebSocket, and others
directly, reducing reliance on polyfills or external packages. 
3. <h4>Native TypeScript Support</h4> 
Bun supports TypeScript out of the box without requiring additional setup or configuration. This makes
it appealing if you're using TypeScript in your projects. 
4. <h4>Cross-Compatibility</h4> 
Bun is designed to
be compatible with Node.js, allowing you to use existing Node.js modules and tools without
modification. Seamless integration: Migrating from other tools like npm or Yarn to Bun is
straightforward 
5. <h4>Lightweight and Resource-Efficient</h4> 
Bun is designed to be lightweight and
resource-efficient, making it suitable for small and large projects alike.

<h2>What can Bun do?</h2>

<h4>All-in-one Toolkit </h4>

Bun is more than just a JavaScript runtime. It has become an All-In-One toolkit,
used from the develop, test, run, and bundle stages when developing JavaScript and TypeScript applications:

1. <b>Package manager </b>
   <br />
   Bun is a package manager that can be compared to npm, pnpm, and Yarn. It can be used to install,
   update, and remove packages from the project. Besides, Bun can also be used to manage the
   project's dependencies, which are stored in the `package.json` file, but Bun use `bun.lockb` file
   to store the dependencies' versions.

2. <b>Bundler</b> <br />
   Bun has also just played the role of a bundler, similar to the role of Vite, Webpack. Bun is
   written to be compatible with ESBuild and for better performance. It will be able to replace
   current tools such as: - `esbuid`, `webpack`, `rollup`, `parcel`, `vite`, `snowpack`, etc.

   <h4>Example</h4>
    Define a components in examples folder like `Component.tsx`
    ```
    export function Component(props: {message: string}) {
        return <h2>{props.message}</h2>
    }
    ```
    Define a main file in examples folder like `index.tsx`
    ```
    import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"
    import { Component } from "./Component"

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!)
    root.render(<Component message="FE tier 1!" />)
    ```
    Run bun build to build the project
    ```
    bun build examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/index.tsx --outdir examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/out
    ```

    The result will be displayed in the `out` folder
    <img className="rounder-md" src="/images/bun_bundle_example.png" alt="bun-build" />
    
    <h4>Options</h4>
    `entrypoint` is the main file that Bun will use to build the project.<br />
    `outdir` is the folder that Bun will use to store the built project.<br />
    `format` is the format of the built project. Bun defaults to "esm", and provides experimental support for "cjs" and "iife".
      


3. <b>Test runner </b> <br />
   Bun has a built-in test runner with a Jest-like expect API. It can be used to run tests and
   generate test reports. Example:

   ```
    import { describe, it, expect } from "bun:test"

    describe("Simple Test Case", () => {
    it("should add two numbers correctly", () => {
        const sum = 1 + 1
        expect(sum).toBe(2)
        })
    })
   ```

   Create file `bun.test.tsx` and run `bun test` to run the test.
   The result will be displayed in the console

   {" "}

   <img className="rounder-md" src="/images/sample_bun_test.png" alt="bun-test" />

4. <b>JavaScript runtime </b> <br /> Bun is a JavaScript runtime that can be used to run JavaScript
   and TypeScript code. It is built on top of JavaScriptCore, which is a high-performance JavaScript
   engine. `Bun` and `NodeJs` are similar in many ways, but there are also some differences.

   <h4> File types </h4>
   Bun supports the following file types:
   - `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.js`
   - Bun supports .jsx and .tsx files out of the box. Bun's internal transpiler converts JSX syntax into vanilla JavaScript before execution.
   <h4> Environment variables </h4>
   - Bun supports environment variables, which are stored in the `.env` file.
   - The current environment variables can be accessed via `process.env`
   - `Bun` also exposes these variables via Bun.env and import.meta.env, which is a simple alias of `process.env`.

   ```
   Bun.env.API_TOKEN; // => "secret"
   import.meta.env.API_TOKEN; // => "secret"
   ```

   <h4>Cross-compile to other platforms </h4>
      Bun can cross-compile to other platforms like `wasm`, `wasi`, `nodejs`, `deno`, `browser`, `electron`, `react-native`, `node-ts`, `bun-ts`, `bun-wasm`, `bun-wasi`, `bun-nodejs`, `bun-deno`, `bun-browser`, `bun-electron`, `bun-react-native`, `bun-node-ts`, `bun-bun-ts`, `bun-bun-wasm`, `bun-bun-wasi`, `bun-bun-nodejs`, `bun-bun-deno`, `bun-bun-browser`
      The --target flag lets you compile your standalone executable for a different operating system, architecture, or version of Bun than the machine you're running bun build on.
   To build for Linux x64 (most servers):
   ```
   bun build --target=bun-linux-x64 examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/index.tsx --outdir examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/out
    
    bun build --target=bun-linux-x64-modern examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/index.tsx --outdir examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/out

   ```

   To build for Windows x64:
   ```
   bun build --target=bun-windows-x64 examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/index.tsx --outdir examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/out

   bun build --target=bun-windows-x64-modern examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/index.tsx --outdir examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/out
   ```
   
   To build for macOS x64:
   ```
   bun build --target=bun-darwin-arm64 examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/index.tsx --outdir examples/javascript/package-manager/bun/out

   ```
  <h4>Bun vs NodeJs</h4>

<Table headers={["Feature", "Bun", "NodeJs"]} data={data} />

<h2>Bun CLI commands</h2>
- `bun init`: Create a new `package.json` file
- `bun install`: Install all dependencies
- `bun install <package-name>`: Install a specific package
- `bun add <package-name>`: Download a particular version of a package and add to the list of dependencies in package.json
- `bun remove <package-name>`: Remove a package from the list of dependencies in `package.json`
- `bun update`: Update all packages to the latest version

<h2>Bun Limitations</h2>

1.  Bun is designed to be compatible with Node.js, but it may not support all Node.js modules or features.
2.  Since Bun is still new, the community and documentation are not as extensive as Nodejs.
