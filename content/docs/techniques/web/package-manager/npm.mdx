## What is `npm`?

Back in the day when you wanted to install a package in your project,
you had to download the package from the internet, extract it,
and then copy the files to your project.
This was a tedious process, especially when you had to manage multiple libraries and their dependencies.
That is the pain that `npm` was created to solve - providing a quick way to manage, install
and update packages in your project.<br/><br/>
Currently `npm` is the oldest and most widely used package manager for JavaScript. Which offer a strong community support and a vast number of packages available in the `npm` registry.

## What can `npm`(Node packages manager) do for you?

### Extensive package management capability
Dependency Management Modern JavaScript applications often rely on multiple third-party libraries
and frameworks. `npm` makes it easy to manage these dependencies by:

- Installing Packages: With `npm`, installing a package is as simple as running `npm install <package-name>`.This command fetches the latest version of the package from the `npm` Registry
and saves it locally in the `node_modules` directory.
- Versioning and Updates: `npm` helps maintain compatibility by allowing you to specify
which versions of a package your project can use. It does this by saving all your dependencies
and their versions in a file called `package.json`.

Example of a package.json file:

```json
   {
     "name": "my-project",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "dependencies": {
       "react": "^17.0.2",
       "express": "^4.17.1",
       "lodash": "^4.17.21"
     }
   }
```

Environment management system: `npm` provides two ways to handle package installations and dependencies: project-specific (local) and system-wide (global) contexts.

- Local: When you install a package using `npm install`, it is saved in the `node_modules` directory.
- Global: When you install a package using `npm install -g`, it is saved in a global directory and can be accessed from any project.

### Cross-project development with package linking

`npm` allows you to link packages across projects, with this:

- It easy to develop and test packages in isolation. This is especially useful when you are working on a library or module that is used across multiple projects.
- By linking the package, you can make changes to the package and see the effects in real-time across all projects that use it.

<strong>Example:</strong>
You have a senerio where you are developing a project name `main-app` and a library name `custom-lib`
that you are working on. You can add the `custom-lib` library to the `main-app` project localy.<br />

First you will need to add the `custom-lib` library to the `npm` registry by running `npm link` in the `custom-lib` directory.
When your `custom-lib` library is added to the `npm` registry the terminal should display a message like this:

```
$ npm link

added 1 package, and audited 3 packages in 1s

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

Next you will need to link the `custom-lib` library to the `main-app` project by running `npm link custom-lib` in the `main-app` directory.
When your `custom-lib` library is linked to the `main-app` project the terminal should look like this:

```
$ npm link custom-lib

added 1 package, and audited 517 packages in 2s

107 packages are looking for funding
run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

Now you can use your own library in your project as if it was a package from the `npm` registry.

## The limitation of `npm`

`npm` is generally consider slower performance compared to newer alternatives like `bun`, ``pnpm``, `yarn` with their new way of approaching package management.
