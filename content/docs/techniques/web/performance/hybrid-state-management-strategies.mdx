## Introduction

Modern web applications face a common challenge: balancing performance, interactivity, and scalability when managing state.
Fetching too much data on the client can lead to sluggish performance, while over-reliance on the server can result in unnecessary network requests and increased latency.

Hybrid state management involves a combination of server state and client state to create efficient, scalable, and performant frontend applications.
It leverages the strengths of both approaches, ensuring seamless data synchronization and optimal user experiences.

## Key Components of Hybrid State Management

**Client-side State**

- State that affects UI interactions (e.g., form inputs, modals, local component states).
- Managed using React hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext) or state libraries like Zustand, Redux, or Jotai.

This refers to state managed in the browser, typically for interactive elements and real-time updates.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react"

function ClientState() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>
}

export default ClientState
```

**Server-side State**

- Data fetched from external source such as an API or database.

- Cached and managed on the server.

- Used to improve performance and reduce unnecessary client-side requests.

This data is typically changes over times and shared between clients, often used for initial page loads and SEO-critical content.

**Synchronization Layer**

This is the mechanism that keeps server and client states in sync.

## Benefits of Hybrid State Management

**Improved Performance**: By leveraging server-side rendering for initial state and client-side updates for interactivity, applications can achieve faster initial load times and responsive user interfaces .

**Enhanced SEO**: Server-rendered content with up-to-date state improves search engine visibility.

**Better User Experience**: Immediate feedback on the client-side combined with consistent server-side state creates a smooth user experience.

**Scalability**: Hybrid approaches can better handle large amounts of data and complex state logic by distributing the load between server and client.

## Strategies to Identify Server State or Client State

To determine whether a piece of state should be managed on the server or client, consider these key questions:

### Does the data need to be available on the initial page load?

If the data is required as soon as the user lands on the page, such as user authentication status or initial dashboard analytics, it should be fetched from the server state.
This ensures that the page is preloaded with the required data, improving perceived performance and user experience.

If the data is only needed after a user interacts with the page (e.g., toggling a setting or entering an input), it can be stored in client state to avoid unnecessary API calls.

### Is the data frequently changing for a single user?

State that frequently changes in response to user actions (e.g., form inputs, toggles, filters) should be handled as client state to avoid excessive API requests and unnecessary re-renders.

On the other hand, data that remains relatively static, such as product lists or user profiles, can be fetched from the server state and cached to minimize redundant API calls.

### Does the data need to persist across page reloads or be globally shared?

If a piece of state needs to be available across multiple pages or after a user reloads the page, it should be managed as server state.
This ensures that the state is consistent and accessible whenever needed.

For example, authentication tokens, user settings, and dashboard data should persist across page reloads, making server state the ideal choice.
In contrast, temporary UI interactions like dropdown selections or modals can be handled as client state.

### Does the state directly impact UI interactivity (e.g., toggles, dropdowns)?

State that directly affects the UI, such as theme preferences, form inputs, or navigation state, is best managed as client state.
This ensures a smooth and responsive user experience without unnecessary network requests.

For example, a dark mode toggle should be handled entirely in client state because there is no need to fetch it from the server every time the user interacts with the page.
However, if theme preferences should persist across sessions, the state should be stored in local storage or updated on the server.

### Does the data require real-time synchronization across multiple clients?

Some applications, such as collaborative tools or chat applications, require real-time data updates across multiple users.
In such cases, a hybrid approach using client state for local responsiveness and server state for real-time updates via WebSockets or polling is the best approach.

For instance, a live chat feature can store the currently typed message in client state while fetching new messages from the server state using WebSockets.

## Hybrid State Management Techniques

### Server-Side Rendering with Client-Side Hydration

### Prefetch and Cache Data with React Query

- Uses background refetching to keep data fresh.
- Reduces redundant requests by caching API responses.

### Context for Dependency Injection
