## Why Server State matters ?

Client state is ideal for managing local, session-specific data but is transient, lacks persistence, struggles with synchronization, and can degrade performance with large datasets.
Server state overcomes these issues by offering centralized, persistent, and scalable solutions. It ensures consistency, enables cross-device synchronization, and handles complex or shared data, serving as a secure and reliable single source of truth for modern applications.

In React, **server state** refers to the client-side representation of data fetched from a server or external data source, such as an API.
It is distinct from client state because it involves continuous synchronization with the server to ensure the data remains up-to-date, accurate, and consistent.
Server state is not the state of the API itself but the client’s management of the data fetched from the server.

## Server State vs Client State

|                      | **Client State**                  | **Server State**              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Source**           | External (APIs, databases)        | Internal (local state, Redux) |
| **Lifespan**         | Typically short-lived (refetched) | Persistent during session     |
| **Nature**           | Asynchronous                      | Synchronous                   |
| **Management Tools** | React Query, SWR, Apollo Client   | useState, Redux, Zustand      |

### Client State

**Trade-offs**

- **Fast Access:** Data is stored locally, meaning there is no need for network requests, resulting in quicker data retrieval.
- **Suitable for Session-Specific Data:** Ideal for handling temporary state within a single session or component.
- **Reduced Server Dependency:** Since client state is stored on the user's device, there is no need for constant communication with the server.

**Limitations**

- **No Persistence Across Sessions:** Data is lost when the page is refreshed or the session ends, which makes it unsuitable for long-term storage.
- **Scalability Challenges:** Managing large or shared data on the client side becomes difficult, particularly when synchronizing data across devices or users.
- **Security Risks:** Client state is vulnerable to manipulation since it resides on the client-side, making it harder to enforce security and data validation.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Storing and processing large datasets on the client can degrade performance, especially in resource-intensive applications.
- **Inconsistent Across Devices or Sessions:** Since data is stored locally, it is not consistent across different devices or sessions, which can lead to a fragmented user experience.

### Server State

**Trade-offs**

- **Persistent Data:** Server state ensures that data is consistent and available across multiple sessions and devices, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Centralized Management:** By managing data on the server, it acts as a single source of truth, ensuring consistency and avoiding duplication.
- **Scalability:** Server state is better suited for applications that need to handle large datasets and provide real-time updates or synchronization across multiple users or devices.
- **Enhanced Security:** With server-side data management, sensitive data can be better secured, as validation and security checks are enforced on the server rather than the client.

**Limitations**

- **Network Dependency:** Server state requires constant network communication, which can introduce latency and performance issues, particularly for real-time applications or when network connectivity is unstable.
- **Server Load:** Managing server state can place significant load on the server, especially when scaling to handle a high volume of requests, which can lead to bottlenecks.
- **Complexity in Real-Time Synchronization:** Ensuring that data remains consistent across multiple devices or users in real-time can be complex and may require advanced techniques like websockets, polling, or caching.
- **Infrastructure Requirements:** Maintaining server state requires robust infrastructure, including server resources, APIs, and data fetching mechanisms, adding to the overall system complexity.

## Data Fetching and Caching

### Data Fetching

Data Fetching refers to the process of retrieving data from external sources like APIs or databases.
To optimize performance, data fetching should be done efficiently by:

- Minimizing the number of requests (batching and pagination).
- Using strategies like debouncing and lazy loading to delay or limit requests.
- Employing cache-first or network-first strategies to ensure that data is either fetched from a cache or the network efficiently.

Basic example of fetching data:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react"

export function Posts() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchPosts() {
      const res = await fetch("https://some-endpoint/posts")
      const data = await res.json()
      setPosts(data)
    }
    fetchPosts()
  }, [])

  if (!posts) return <div>Loading...</div>

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

### Data Caching

Caching is storing data locally, which avoids redundant requests and improves the speed of subsequent interactions.
Some strategies include:

- Cache-first: Serve data from the cache before reaching out to the network.
- Stale-while-revalidate: Serve cached data immediately and fetch updated data in the background.

Here’s an example of caching and stale whilerevalidate by using React Query:

```js
import { useQuery } from "react-query"
import axios from "axios"

const fetchPostData = async () => {
  await fetch("https://some-endpoint/posts")
  return await res.json()
}

// Cached Post List
const Posts = () => {
  const { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery("post", fetchPostData, {
    cacheTime: 5 * 60 * 1000 // Cache data for 5 minutes
  })
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (isError) return <div>Error loading posts data</div>
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

// Staled Post List
const Posts = () => {
  const { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery("post", fetchPostData, {
    staleTime: 60 * 1000, // Consider data fresh for 1 minute
    refetchOnWindowFocus: true // Revalidate when the window is focused
  })
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (isError) return <div>Error loading posts data</div>
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

### Prefetching and Lazy Loading

**Prefetching**

Prefetching involves fetching data before it is needed.
This strategy is used to load data in advance, such as when the user is about to navigate to a specific page or interact with a feature, reducing perceived latency.

Benefits of Prefetching:

- Improves user experience by reducing wait times for data.
- Ideal for scenarios where the next user action can be predicted.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, useQuery, useQueryClient } from "react-query"

const fetchUserProfile = async (id: string) => {
  return await fetch(`/api/post/${id}`)
}

const UserProfile = ({ userId }: { userId: string }) => {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery(["post", userId], () => fetchUserProfile(userId))

  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

const App = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()

  // Prefetching data for a post
  const prefetchUserProfile = async (userId: string) => {
    await queryClient.prefetchQuery(["user", userId], () => fetchUserProfile(userId))
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onMouseEnter={() => prefetchUserProfile("123")}>Hover to Prefetch</button>
      <UserProfile userId="123" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example:

- **prefetchQuery** is used to fetch the user profile when the user hovers over a button.
- When the user finally navigates to the profile, the data is already loaded.

**Lazy Loading**

Lazy loading fetches data only when it is needed.
This strategy helps reduce the initial load time by delaying data fetching for parts of the application that aren’t immediately visible or required.

Benefits of Lazy Loading:

- Reduces the amount of data fetched upfront.
- Improves performance by deferring non-critical resource loading.

## Data Management and Synchronization

### Real-Time Data Synchronization

Real-time synchronization keeps client-side data updated with server-side changes, ensuring seamless user experiences in applications like messaging platforms, dashboards, or collaborative tools.
Below are code examples for implementing Polling, WebSockets, and Server-Side Events (SSE).

**Polling**

Periodically fetching data to keep the client and server in sync.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "react-query"

const fetchLatestData = async () => await fetch("/api/data")

const PollingExample = () => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery("latestData", fetchLatestData, {
    refetchInterval: 5000 // Fetch data every 5 seconds
  })

  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>
  if (error) return <p>Error fetching data</p>

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Real-Time Data</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}

export default PollingExample
```

**WebSockets**

WebSockets provide a persistent, full-duplex communication channel for real-time updates.
It can keep data synchronized by establishing a persistent connection between client and server for real-time updates.

**Example: WebSockets with React**

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

const WebSocketExample = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<string[]>([])

  useEffect(() => {
    const socket = new WebSocket("ws://example.com/socket")

    socket.onmessage = event => {
      setMessages(prev => [...prev, event.data])
    }

    socket.onclose = () => {
      console.log("WebSocket connection closed")
    }

    return () => socket.close() // Clean up on component unmount
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Real-Time Messages</h1>
      <ul>
        {messages.map((msg, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{msg}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default WebSocketExample
```

**Server-Side Events (SSE)**

SSE provides a lightweight mechanism for the server to push updates to the client when data changes.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

const SSEExample = () => {
  const [events, setEvents] = useState<string[]>([])

  useEffect(() => {
    const eventSource = new EventSource("/api/events")

    eventSource.onmessage = event => {
      setEvents(prev => [...prev, event.data])
    }

    eventSource.onerror = () => {
      console.error("SSE connection failed")
      eventSource.close()
    }

    return () => eventSource.close() // Clean up on component unmount
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Server-Sent Events</h1>
      <ul>
        {events.map((event, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{event}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default SSEExample
```

In this example:

- **EventSource** is used to establish a connection for receiving server updates.
- Events from the server are appended to the local state.

**Real data handling techniques comparisions:**

| Technique      | **Use Case**                     | **Pros**                             | **Cons**                             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Polling**    | Periodic updates, non-critical   | Simple to implement                  | Higher network usage                 |
| **WebSockets** | Real-time, bidirectional updates | Low latency, efficient communication | More complex to implement and manage |
| **SSE**        | Real-time, one-way updates       | Lightweight, easy to implement       | Limited to one-way communication     |

### Large Data Handling

Efficiently managing large datasets is critical for ensuring application performance and scalability.
Below are strategies and best practices to handle large data effectively in server state management:

**Pagination:**

- Load data in smaller, manageable chunks to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
- Load data incrementally using query parameters such as page and limit.
- Reduces memory usage and improves loading times.

**Infinite Scrolling:**

- Dynamically fetch and append data as users scroll down.
- Provides a seamless user experience without overloading the client with unnecessary data upfront.

**Virtualization:**

- Render only the visible portion of a dataset within the user's viewport.
- Reduces memory consumption and improves rendering performance, especially for lists and tables.

**Lazy Loading:**

- Load data or components only when needed, such as when a user navigates to a specific section.
- Helps reduce initial load times and improves perceived performance.

By adopting these strategies, you can ensure smooth handling of large datasets while maintaining application responsiveness and user satisfaction.

## Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms

In any application that fetches data from an external source, handling errors and ensuring data fetching operations are resilient is crucial for providing a smooth user experience.
Failures in network requests or API responses can impact the user experience and may lead to frustrated users.
Therefore, implementing error handling and retry mechanisms can help mitigate these issues effectively.

Handling errors and ensuring data fetching operations are resilient is vital for a smooth user experience. Considerations include:

- Automatic Retry: If a request fails, automatically retry it a specified number of times to handle network issues.
- Exponential Backoff: Increase the delay between retries to prevent overwhelming the server with too many requests.
- Error Boundaries: Use components like React’s Error Boundaries to gracefully handle UI crashes and display fallback content or messages when an error occurs.

With _react-query_, it provides built-in support for retry mechanisms. You can configure automatic retries and exponential backoff strategies easily using its options:

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "react-query"

// Fetch function for data
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Network response was not ok")
  }
  return response.json()
}

// Using react-query with automatic retry and exponential backoff
const DataComponent = () => {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery("data", fetchData, {
    retry: 3, // Retry up to 3 times if the request fails
    retryDelay: attemptIndex => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000), // Exponential backoff: retry after 1s, 2s, 4s, etc., max 30s
    onError: error => {
      console.error("Data fetching failed:", error)
    }
  })

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>

  return <div>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</div>
}
```

For handling errors, we can create an Error Boundaries component to catch error in the rendering phase, lifecycle methods, and constructors of the whole tree below them.

```tsx
import React, { Component } from "react"

// Error Boundary Component
class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { hasError: false, errorInfo: null }
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true } // Update state to indicate an error has occurred
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    this.setState({ errorInfo })
    console.error("Error occurred:", error, errorInfo)
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Something went wrong. Please try again later.</h1>
          <p>{this.state.errorInfo?.componentStack}</p>
        </div>
      )
    }

    return this.props.children
  }
}

// Using Error Boundary in the application
const App = () => (
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <ChildrenComponent />
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

In this example, **Error Boundary** catches any JavaScript errors that occur in the components inside its boundary (in this case, the `ChildrenComponent`) and show a error message on the UI.

---

## Security Considerations

To protect user data and ensure secure communication between the client and server, follow these specific security practices:

**Data Storage and Exposure**

- Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Client State: Do not store passwords, API keys, or PII in client state. Use server-side mechanisms for sensitive data.

- Minimize Data Exposure: Fetch and store only the data required for the current interaction. Use tools like GraphQL or REST filters to limit unnecessary data in responses.

- Use Secure Storage Mechanisms: Prefer secure alternatives like HTTP-only cookies for session tokens, and encrypt locally stored data.

**Protection Against Attacks**

- Protect Against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Sanitize dynamic content using libraries like DOMPurify to block malicious scripts.

```js
import DOMPurify from "dompurify"

const unsafeHTML = '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS Attack\')">'
const safeHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(unsafeHTML)
document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = safeHTML
```

- Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Secure client-to-server requests with CSRF tokens and enforce CORS policies.

- Encrypt Communication: Use HTTPS to secure data transmission and update TLS certificates regularly.

## Advanced Server State Management

### Centralized Data Management

Centralized Data Management refers to the practice of consolidating all logic related to fetching, updating, and managing data into a single location.
This approach ensures that data flow is predictable and maintainable, and that components or parts of an application that need access to the data are accessing it through a unified mechanism.

In the context of client-side state management, Centralized Data Management can be implemented using tools like an API Service Layer, global state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand), or React's Context API.
Centralizing data ensures consistency across the application and minimizes issues related to data duplication and synchronization.

**Key components of Centralized Data Management**

- API Service Layer: An API Service Layer abstracts the logic for fetching data from external sources, such as APIs.

```tsx
import Axios, { AxiosError, InternalAxiosRequestConfig } from "axios"
import axios from "axios"

const baseAxios = axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://example-endpoint.com/api/",
  headers: {
    // Authorization: `<Your Auth Token>`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    timeout: 1000
  }
  // .. other options
})

// Automatically add token into each request
function authRequestInterceptor(config: InternalAxiosRequestConfig) {
  if (config.method === "post") {
    config.headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
  }
  const token = Cookies.get("access-token")
  config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`
  return config
}

// This response interceptor will refetch the access token with specific response error code
const onResponseError = async (
  error: AxiosError<{ message: string | undefined; data: unknown }>
) => {
  const message = error.response?.data.message
  const refreshToken = Cookies.get("refresh-token")
  // check response status code
  if (error.response?.status !== 401 || !refreshToken) {
    return Promise.reject(error)
  }
  // refetch access token
  try {
    const response = await getRefreshToken(refreshToken)
    Cookies.set("access-token", response.data.data.accessToken, {
      expires: COOKIES_EXPIRED_AT
    })
    const initialRequest = error.config
    if (!initialRequest) throw new Error()
    initialRequest.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${response.data.data.accessToken}`
    return axios.request(initialRequest)
  } catch (refreshTokenError) {
    Cookies.set("access-token", "")
    Cookies.set("refresh-token", "")
    return Promise.reject(error)
  }
}

baseAxios.interceptors.request.use(authRequestInterceptor)
baseAxios.interceptors.response.use(authResoponseInterceptor, onResponseError)
```

- State Management Libraries: Libraries like Redux, Zustand, and React Query centralize data management by providing tools to handle global or shared state.
  These libraries help manage application-wide state in one place, which is useful when multiple components need access to the same data.

- Data Fetching and Caching: To improve performance, a centralized data management system often incorporates caching mechanisms (e.g., using libraries like React Query, Apollo Client) to store data locally and reduce redundant requests.

### State Normalization

For applications with complex or relational data, normalization simplifies state updates and avoids redundant data storage.

State normalization typically involves two main components:

1. Entities: These are the core pieces of data in the application, such as users, products, or posts.
   Each entity is stored in its own separate structure, usually indexed by a unique identifier (like an ID).
2. References: Rather than storing related entities together, the relationships are stored as references (IDs) between entities.
   For example, instead of storing a user object inside a post object, we store the userId in the post object and fetch the full user object separately when needed.

Let’s take an example of a blog application with users and posts

```js
// Without normalization, the state might look like this:
const state = {
  posts: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "Post 1",
      content: "This is post 1",
      user: {
        id: 1,
        name: "John Doe"
      }
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Post 2",
      content: "This is post 2",
      user: {
        id: 2,
        name: "Jane Doe"
      }
    }
  ]
}

// With normalization, the state would look like this:
const normalizedState = {
  users: {
    1: { id: 1, name: "John Doe" },
    2: { id: 2, name: "Jane Doe" }
  },
  posts: {
    1: { id: 1, title: "Post 1", content: "This is post 1", userId: 1 },
    2: { id: 2, title: "Post 2", content: "This is post 2", userId: 2 }
  }
}
```

This way, when we need to update a user's data (for example, changing "John Doe" to "John Smith"), we only need to make the change in one place (the users object), and it will reflect across all posts that reference that user.

### Optimistic Updates

Optimistic updates are a technique used to improve the user experience by immediately reflecting changes in the UI before they are confirmed by the server.
Instead of waiting for a network request to complete, the application assumes the request will succeed and updates the UI accordingly.
This results in a more responsive and snappy user interface, especially in applications that require frequent interactions or real-time updates.

Optimistic updates are particularly useful in scenarios where users interact with the application frequently, and the request response time is noticeable, such as submitting a form, liking a post, or making a purchase.

**How Optimistic Updates Work**

1. Assume Success: When a user performs an action, like submitting a form, the application optimistically assumes that the request will succeed.
   The UI is updated immediately to reflect the change.
2. Make the Request: The application then sends the request to the server in the background.
3. Handle Response: Once the server responds, the application either commits the change if the request was successful or reverts the UI update if the request fails.
4. Rollback in Case of Failure: If the server indicates an error (such as a failed request), the UI is reverted back to its previous state, and an error message can be shown to the user.

## Best Practices & Tips

**Building an API Service Layer**

- Centralized HTTP Client: Set up a single instance of an HTTP client, such as Axios or Fetch API, that can be reused across the project.
  This ensures consistency in API requests by applying default configurations like base URLs, headers, timeouts, and authentication tokens.
- Control Data Transfer with Interceptors: Leverage Axios interceptors (or similar functionality in other HTTP clients) to manipulate request and response data before they are sent or received.
  For example, interceptors can be used to add authentication tokens to headers, log API requests, or handle global error handling.
- Building an API Abort controller system: Use the AbortController API or similar mechanisms to enable cancellation of ongoing API requests.

**Implementing a Custom Hook for Optimistic Updates**

Optimistic updates enhance user experience by immediately reflecting changes in the UI without waiting for server confirmation.
By creating a reusable custom hook, you can standardize and simplify the implementation of optimistic updates across your application.

**Using external libraries for state management**

External libraries can simplify state management by providing robust tools and patterns to handle complex application requirements.
However, their integration should be deliberate and aligned with the application’s architecture and goals.

These are some Libraries that support state management:

| Library     | Use Case                                | Key Features                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| React Query | Server state management                 | Caching, background revalidation, pagination |
| SWR         | Lightweight server state management     | Focused on fetching and caching              |
| Redux       | Complex state management                | Predictable state container, middleware      |
| Zustand     | Simplified global state management      | Minimalistic, no boilerplate                 |
| Recoil      | State management for React applications | Works with React's Suspense                  |

By carefully selecting and integrating external libraries, you can manage application state effectively while maintaining performance, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
